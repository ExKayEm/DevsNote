        <p id="Note">Welcome to K-Pay! This function (Developer's Note) is a new function and as written in the K-Pay's Policy (which will appear soon in the app itself) grants us the permission to keep the notes out of the language translation. But don't be sad, we are planning on creating a system that translates both this note and the new update log!</p>
